\section{Motivation for the work}
\begin{frame}{OpenMP to target GPUs}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{1.2em}
    \item 5 of top 10 supercomputers are GPU based machines
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most of the codes optimized for CPUs have to now
            be rewritten to take advantage of the graphics card
    \end{itemize}
    \item OpenMP~4.5 supports GPU offloading
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Port incrementally for big codes
        \item Control the parallelization via compile time flags
        \item Need not be concerned with optimizations for newer architectures
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bottleneck - Find compilers that support OpenMP~4.5
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\subsection{}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conclusions of the work}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{1.2em}
    \item No uniformity in OpenMP~4.5 directive mapping on GPU hardware among compilers
    \item No uniformity in the interpretation of compiler directives on CPUs
    \item Moving target and hence a lot of small issues are not fixed
\end{itemize}
